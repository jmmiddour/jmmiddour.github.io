### A little about my life:
My name is Joanne Middour. I live in a very rural area of North Cental Florida. I have been working since I was 15 years old in various types of fields. I also did some babysitting and chores for my parents and others prior to the age of 15 to earn spending money.   

I started out working as a babysitter for a church on Sundays while the parents attended church. I worked as a cashier in a grocery store. I have been a waitress in several different restruants. I did a lot of office work as... 
* A dispatcher for a fast-paced plumbing company, 
* An admistrative assistant to the owners of a small company, 
* Customer service in a call center, 
* Some accounting, 
* Data entry, 
* Filing, 
* Taking insurance claims, 
* and several other typical office responsabilities. 
* I have owned and ran my own online business while also driving team with my husband and we pulled a 53' trailer. 
* I also worked in a tech library for an airplane repair facility with some well know airlines. 
* For a short time I also did some transcribing work remotely.

I am a home manager, teacher, cook, maid, pet owner, referee, accountant, nurse, chauffeur and every other aspect of being a stay at home mom. I have been attending Lambda School since May 4, 2020. I have also been the committee chair of our local BSA Cub Scout pack for the past 3 years.

### Why I want to be a Data Scientist?
I have always enjoyed working with numbers. At one point I was thinking of going to school to be an accountant. However, when I found out about Lambda School, I started to research what a Data Scientist does and felt that it was the perfect fit for me. I am very analytical and everyone always tells me I overthink things all the time. I am very detail oriented. I love solving puzzles. I even thought about getting into some aspect of the Criminology field at one point because of my love of solving problems but Data Science is a much safer career. I have always believed the saying, "Numbers never lie, only people do." I find it very interesting that you can take a set of values from information in the past and fairly accurately predict the outcome of what may happen in the future just based on that information. I also like the idea of being able to work remotely so I can spend more time with my family and less time traveling. Being that we live in a very rural area, saving travel time for me is a major advantage.
