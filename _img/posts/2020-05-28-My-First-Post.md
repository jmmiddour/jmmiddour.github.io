# My New Journey:

I have been a student at Lambda School since May 4, 2020. You can see my [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/jmmiddour). 
There have been a lot of ups and downs so far.   

I want to share 2 of my current favorite ups:  
- First one was getting a 3 on my very first graded assignment.  
- The second was getting a 3 on my first sprint challenge.

I want to show just a few of the markdowns that I have learned to do:

* I know how to create a table on this page:

  What is your favorite pet?  
  Based on 100 people [^1]
  
  |  Cat |  Dog |  Bird |  Mouse |  Snake |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  |  34 |  42 |  14 |  7 |  3 |
  
* I can add **bold text**

* I can add _italized text_ 

* I can add **_bold and italized text_**

* I can add code:

  ```python
  print ('Hello World!')
  ```
  
* I can add a fenced code block:

  ```python  
  print ('Hello ')  
  print ('World!')  
  ```
* I can ~~stike through~~ a ~~word~~

* I can add a check list:

  How to become a Data Scientist:  
  - [x] Apply to Lambda School.  
  - [x] Complete pre-course work or take the challenge.  
  - [x] Get accepted into Lambda School.  
  - [ ] Complete Lambda School.  
  - [ ] Get a great job that I love doing.
  
* I can create a definitions list:
  
  - First Definition  
  : This is the definition of the first word.
  
  - Second Definition  
  : This is one definition of the second word.  
  : This is another definition of the second word.
    
These are just a few things that I can do with markdown code. 

I am excited to continue on this journey with Lambda!
