## Cannabis Strains API

This project was the first one where I worked with a team. The team consisted of 6 full stack web students and 3 Data Science students. I was in unit 3 at Lambda at the time of the creatation. Of the other Data Science students there was another unit 3 student and a unit 4 student. Being a unit 3 student we were tasked with creating the API to connect the the front end to the database and the predictive NLP model, which was created and trained by the unit 4 student. Then our API returned a json file for the web team to use based on the string(s) they sent to our API.

## How to use our API

Once you click the [link](https://strains-cannabis.herokuapp.com/) to go to our API, you will see the above image. At the top of the page, just below the image, is a [link](https://strains-cannabis.herokuapp.com/redoc) where you can view the docs for our API. Our API is simple to navigate.
