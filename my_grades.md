I have been attending Lambda School since May 4, 2020.

Lambda School does not go by a traditional grading scale. 

**Lambda School's grading scale is as follows:**
- 1 == *Needs Improvement*
- 2 == *Understands all the Concepts - Met all Expectations*
- 3 == *Exceded Expectations - Went Above and Beyond*



<details>
  <summary><b>Unit 1: Statistics Fundamentals</b></summary><br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sprint 1: Data Wrangling and Storytelling == 3</strong><br>
      May 17, 2020 - Feedback from my Team Lead: "<em>You hammered home the crosstabs! Good job and I love your use of comments. Some of the code could have been merged into the cell of another, but overall, you crushed it!</em>"</li><br>
      <li><strong>Sprint 2: Statistical Test and Experiments == 3</strong><br>
      Jun 1, 2020 - Feedback from my Team Lead: "<em>Good job! Code was clean, good and solid. Good job reaching for those stretch goals!</em>"</li><br>
      <li><strong>Sprint 3: Linear Algebra == 3</strong><br>
      Jun 15, 2020 - Feedback from my Team Lead: "<em>Exceeded expectations - Great work! Stretch goals completed and very solid understanding of concepts.</em>"</li><br>
      <li><strong>Build Week Project == 2</strong><br>
      Jun 25, 2020 - Feedback from my Team Lead: "<em>Per Austin - no 3's will be given for this. That said, you met expectations defined in the project in the given time. Your research question was appropriate and the blog matches in a way that is easy to follow. Your visuals are very well done and clearly come from your dataset. Your notebook runs top to bottom without any trouble. All 170+ cells, WOW! And on top of all that, your presentation was fantastic! Great Job!</em>"</li>
    </ul>

  <summary><strong>Unit 2: Predictive Modeling</strong></summary><br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sprint 1: Linear Models == 3</strong><br>
      Jul 20, 2020 - Feedback from my Team Lead: "<em>I feel like I’m grading Buzz Light Year, because you to infinity and beyond! Great job, Joanne! You’ve met all the requirements and then exceeded some. The scores you got were great, and you definitely earned a 3!</em>"</li><br>
      <li><strong>Sprint 2: Kaggle Challenge == 2</strong><br>
      Aug 2, 2020 - Feedback from my Team Lead: "<em>I must admit, the first thing I notice is that huge list of imports. :-) You did a very good job and showed mastery in every area. Didn’t quite meet the stretch goals, but I’m sure with more time, It would have been a piece of cake. Great job tackling both the Decision Tree & Random Forest! Your test have above average scores. Excellent work, Joanne!</em>"</li><br>
      <li><strong>Sprint 3: Applied Modeling == 2</strong><br>
      Aug 17, 2020 - Feedback from my Team Lead: "<em>Great job, Joanne! It looks like you put a lot of work into it considering how you were feeling the past several days. Your score exceeds the minimum 60%. And you were visualizations to look great. Fantastic work!</em>"</li><br>
      <li><strong>Build Week Project == 2</strong><br>
      Aug 31, 2020 - Feedback from my Team Lead: "<em>Joanne demonstrated mastery in each of the six objectives of her build. Her work was outstanding and her blog was fantastic, backed by the work she did with her model predictions. Great work, Joanne.</em>"</li>
    </ul>

<details>
  <summary><b>Unit 3: Data Engineering</b></summary><br>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Sprint 1: Software Engineering and Reproducible Research == 2</strong><br>
        Sept 14, 2020 - Feedback from my Team Lead: "<em>A bit of a rough Sprint Challenge. You passed, but I'd highly recommend studying up on this. Lot's of hard work, more ahead. :-)</em>"<br><br>
        <ul><li><strong>Note:</strong><br>This was a difficult Sprint Challenge for me because I was working a lot of hours at my current job and pulling in overtime every chance I was able to. Therefore, I was not able to devote as much time as I needed to study on my own and when I was doing my school work I was extremely exhausted. However, I overcame that challenge in my life, at the time, and was able to pass regardless.</li></ul>
      </li><br>
      <li><strong>Sprint 2: SQL and Databases == 3</strong><br>
        Sept 28, 2020 - Feedback from my Team Lead: "<em>You took this sprint challenge like a champ! Well done.</em>"</li><br>
      <li><strong>Sprint 3: Productization and Cloud == 2</strong><br>
        Oct 13, 2020 - Feedback from my Team Lead: "<em>Hey, I apologize for the late feedback. Things look good here. I'm glad you were able to figure that out. :-)</em>"</li><br>
      <li><strong>Build Week Project == 3</strong><br>
        Oct 25, 2020 - Feedback from my Team Lead: "<em>Very goood work!</em>"</li>

#### > Starting in Unit 4, Lambda enforced some changes to the program grading structure:
  - Currently Lambda has made all assignments within a sprint self-graded. We were not able to see the grades on our assignments before, we were just told by our TL (Team Lead) what we got on it.
  - Lambda also changed the grading for the Sprint Challenges. They are now self graded, but I have voiced my concerns on this and several other students have voiced their concerns as well. We, as students, are trying to get this changed.
  - During the submission of every assignment and Sprint Challenge there is also an auto-graded quiz we have to do to check for understanding of the content. Then we have to fill out a survey they call a "pulse check" where we self grade ourselves.
  - As far as my understanding at this moment, the only thing that will be actually graded by an instructor will be the Build Week projects.
  
  - Lambda also enforced a Mentor/Mentee Leadership Program
    - In Unit 4 I was a Mentor to a student in Unit 2.
    - In Unit 4 I had a Mentor in the Computer Science unit.
