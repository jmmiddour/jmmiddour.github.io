      <ul>
      <p><em>Completed:</em> October 29, 2020</p>
      <p>This project was the first one where I worked with a team. I was in unit 3 at Lambda at the time and we were tasked with creating the API to connect front end to the database and the predictive NLP model, which was created by our DS unit 4 person. There was 2 DS unit 3 students, 1 DS unit 4 student, and 6 WEB students that participated in the creatation of the entire website.

  <summary><strong>Twitoff: A Tweet Predictor</strong></summary><br>
    <img style="padding-left: 30px" src="/assets/img/posts/Twit-off_screenshot.jpg" width="100%" height="75%"><br>
      <ul>
      <p><em>Completed:</em> October 10, 2020</p>
      <p>This project was something that we created over a 2 week period within Unit 3 at Lambda. This is something that we worked on as a class and then added our own individual code to in order to personalize it. We used Flask to create the app and basic html code that I later researched and modified. We also deployed this app to Heruko. A lot of this project was working on learning how to debug problems while also learning how to create an app that anyone can access and use.

  <summary><strong>What will be the Most Seen Shape of UFOs in the Future</strong></summary><br>
    <img style="padding-left: 30px" src="/assets/img/posts/UFO.jpg" width="100%" height="75%"><br>
      <ul>
      <p><em>Completed:</em> August 27, 2020</p>
      <p>This was my second project on my path to being a Data Scientist. This was my Unit 2 Build Week project at Lambda. The goal on this project was to put into practice what we have learned throughout the unit which was Predicitive Modeling. This unit included learning about linear modeling, how to compete in a Kaggle challenge, and applied modeling. The reason why I chose UFOs was because the reporting of UFOs has always fasinated me. Some of the data that the research revealed surprised me and there was some that were not very surprising at all.

  <summary><strong>How Changes have Affected the Powerball Lottery in the USA</strong></summary><br>
    <img style="padding-left: 30px" src="/assets/img/posts/powerball_banner.jpg" width="100%" height="50%"><br>
      <ul>
      <p><em>Completed:</em> June 25, 2020</p>
      <p>This was the first project I ever did on the path to being a Data Scientist. This was my Unit 1 Build Week project at Lambda. The goal on this project was to put into practice what we have learned for that unit which was Statistics Fundamentals. This unit included learning about data wrangling and storytelling, statistical tests and experiments, and linear algebra. The reason why I chose the Powerball was because I have been curious for a while about how the changes have affected the chances of winning over the years. Some of the data that the research revealed surprised me and there was some that were not very surprising at all.

> **A note about my website:**  

>  You will notice that there is a slight difference in the appearence of how my blog posts look when you view them on [Medium](https://medium.com/@magical_satin_seal_239) vs my own page [here](https://joannemiddour.com/). The reason for this is the different syling of the websites. All the information is the same, however, just the format looks slightly different. I try to maintain the same format as best as I can but there are some aspects of the Medium site that I am unable to reproduce at this time.  
  
>  I do not have any real experience when it comes to html, css, and/or java script at this time. Therefore, what you see as far as formatting on my site is all self taught and based on a templete that I use called "Sleek" which is a Jekyll theme. I have made a few modifications to the template code based on some research I have done to make it more personal to me. My blog post and all the pages within my website are done mostly in markdown code.
